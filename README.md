  ## Description
  This is an application that allows a user to build the basic structure of a social networking API using MongoDB. The user will be able to create a new user, update that user, and also add and remove friends. Additionally, the user will be able to create and post thoughts, update those thoughts, as well as add and remove reactions to other users' thoughts. Below is a link to a video demonstrating the functionality of these different routes in action through Insomnia.
